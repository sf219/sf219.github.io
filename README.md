This site is based on the **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)** theme, a two-column responsive Jekyll theme perfect for powering your GitHub hosted blog.

The webpage is built up on top of **[Jordi Pont-Tuset's site](https://jponttuset.cat/building-an-academic-website/)**. Kudos to him.
