Here I will drop some pages and facts I have found interesting. Most of them are resources that make my life easier. Others, tools I wish someone had told me about before. Ideally, I would like it to become a curated list of relevant resources available on the internet. Let's see how it works in practice.

<h3 style="font-family:Tahoma"> Research </h3>

<ul>
  <li>You can access our ENF Moving Videos Database, which has been downloaded more than <strong>five hundred times</strong>, by clicking <a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3549379" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

  <br/>

  <li>I find the way in which information is communicated to be an art in itself. I try (sometimes with little success) to follow some guidelines <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19160-7" target="_blanck"> on the use of color</a>, or while <a href="http://personal.cege.umn.edu/~smith/supplements/poster/guide.htm" target="_blanck">preparing posters</a>, <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/helps/self-help-resources/presentation-skills/conference-presentations" target="_blanck">presentations</a>, and <a href="https://billf.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/cvprPapers.pdf" target="_blanck">writing papers</a>. </li>
 <br/>
 <li>Some interesting things, very up-to-date due to the COVID crisis, on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-science-cancer-idUSBRE82R12P20120328" target = "_blanck">research replicability or selective inference</a>, <a href="http://slow-science.org/" target="_blanck">slow science</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/ru-cwt021119.php" target = "_blanck">machine learning</a>. </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-family:Tahoma"> Technical Resources </h3>

<ul>
  <li> For a good guide on setting up your own webpage, have a look at <a href="https://jponttuset.cat/building-an-academic-website/" target="_blanck">Jordi Pont-Tuset's blog</a>, which is at the very foundation of my website. Another interesting resource might be <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blanck"> Jekyll's website</a>.</li>
  <br/>
  <li> For typing, Vim is all I need.</li>
 <br/>
 <li> A comparison of different reference management software can be found <a href="https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1320978/1320978.pdf" target="_blanck">here</a>. Personally, I like <a href="https://www.jabref.org/" target="_blanck">JabRef</a>. For keeping the publications page up to date, I use <a href="https://github.com/fitheart/PubListX" target="_blanck">PubListX</a>.  </li>  
 <br/>
  <li> I rely on <a href= "https://www.mathcha.io/" target = "_blanck"> Mathcha </a> for doing diagrams with mathematical formulas. </li>   
   <br/>
  <li> <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/" target="_blanck">Grammarly</a> helps a lot. I'm still surprised they don't have support for Spanish texts, I'd use it for sure. </li>   

  </ul>
